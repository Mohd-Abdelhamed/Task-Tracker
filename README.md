## Task Tracker
I built a task tracker using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a web application that helps users track and manage tasks effectively. Vue.js provides a robust framework for creating interactive interfaces, while HTML and CSS structure and style the user interface. JavaScript handles the application's logic, including task manipulation and data storage. Overall, your task tracker offers users an intuitive and efficient way to manage tasks by leveraging the capabilities of Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
